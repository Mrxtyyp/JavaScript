## Differences between map and weakMap:

### Map

The map essentially is a set of key-value pairs. The map stucture is similar to the object. however, the range of keys is not limited to strings. various types of values can be used as keys.

### WeakMap

The weakmap structure is similar to the map structure. and it is also the set of key-value pairs. but the keys in weakmap is only accept object data (except null). The key names of WeakMap objects are not counted in the garbage collection mechanism.
